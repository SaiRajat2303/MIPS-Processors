# MIPS-Processors
MIPS based Single Cycle Processor

This repository contains the code for Single Cycle MIPS processor that supports R - type instructions , I - type instructions and branch instructions (both conditional and unconditional)

One can refer to the computer architecture textbook to understand how datapaths work in case of a MIPS processor while trying to understand the codebase.

This has been a combined effort by Sai Rajat and Koustav Basu , as a part of our coursework at BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus.
